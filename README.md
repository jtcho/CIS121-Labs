CIS121 Lab Handouts
===================

Repository for storing and updating lab (recitation) materials for [CIS121: Data Structures and Algorithms With Java](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis121) at the University of Pennsylvania.

#Setup
Install TeX Live onto your machine. For OSX, install MacTeX. Make sure that you have command-line access set up.

`git clone` this repository onto your local machine.

`cd` into the directory.

Use the command:

``
xelatex --shell-escape <filename>.tex
``

to compile your TeX file as a PDF.

**You must use XeLaTeX and the shell-escape flag.**

#Scripts
Various utility scripts are provided for convenience.

##Cleanup
To quickly remove the miscellaneous .aux, .log, etc. files generated by LaTeX, run the cleanup script:

``
sh scripts/cleanup.sh
``

##Module Generation
The project hierarchy is as follows. Individual modules (for each lab) are given their own folder inside `./modules`. Each module has a `partial.tex` file which is **required**.

To generate an in-directory PDF of a specific module, run:

``
sh scripts/generate-module.sh
``
and pass in the directory name of the module.
